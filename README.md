Project Overview
Title: Climate Stories of 2023
Description:
This project uses data from the U.S. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Center to craft compelling narratives about climate change. The goal is to educate the general public, motivate action, and explain various climate-related phenomena using scientific data.

The project includes visualizations and text to present a clear, engaging story about climate change. The narrative is built on GHG Center datasets and may include supplementary data from other open-source repositories.

Objectives:
Educate: Present climate science data in an accessible way for a general audience.
Motivate: Encourage readers to take action based on the evidence of climate impacts.
Explain: Provide detailed explanations of climate phenomena like rising temperatures, extreme weather, and melting ice sheets.
Project Structure
HTML File (index.html):
This file contains the structure of the website, featuring sections such as:

Climate Story of 2023
Greenhouse Gas Cycle
Role of Carbon in the Earth System
Natural Sources and Sinks of Carbon Dioxide
Atmospheric Conditions
Share Your Climate Story (interactive form for users)
CSS File (styles.css):
Contains the styling for the website, ensuring a clean, readable layout for users across devices. It features a responsive design for mobile compatibility.

JavaScript File (script.js):
Contains interactivity for the website, such as handling the submission of user-generated climate stories and updating the webpage dynamically.

Features
Main Climate Story:
This section offers a broad overview of the climate crisis in 2023, using data from the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center. It highlights the key drivers of GHG emissions and their impacts on global climate patterns.

Visualizations:
Visual tools will be integrated to present data-driven insights using the GHG Center’s tools and other visualization software. These can include charts, maps, and graphs to highlight key data points.

Interactive Section:
Users can submit their own climate stories through a form, creating a community-driven narrative. The submitted stories are displayed dynamically on the site.

Educational Explanations:
Key concepts related to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon cycles, and the role of carbon sinks (oceans, forests) are explained in an accessible manner.
