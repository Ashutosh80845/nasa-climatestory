            <h2>Climate Story of 2023</h2>
            <p>
                In 2023, the impacts of climate change became increasingly evident across the globe. 
                Severe weather events, including hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, intensified. 
                Data from the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center indicated a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions,
                attributed largely to industrial activities and transportation. 
                Communities took action, advocating for renewable energy solutions and sustainable practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                As awareness grows, individuals and organizations are working together to mitigate the effects of climate change. 
                The call for urgent action has never been louder, with a focus on carbon neutrality and ecosystem restoration.

            <h2>Green House Gas Cycle</h2>
            <p>
                In our atmosphere, greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket. They keep heat in and warm the Earth. 
                Carbon-containing molecules like carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane 'cycle', or move to and from, the atmosphere. 
                These cycles include both emissions into the atmosphere, or 'sources', from human activities and natural processes, 
                and 'sinks', like plants and oceans, which absorb these chemical components from the atmosphere. 
                Understanding and quantifying how these sources and sinks are changing is critically important for policymakers, 
                local environmental managers, and scientists working to predict climate in the coming decades.

            <h2>The Role of Carbon in the Earth System</h2>
            <p>
                The movement of carbon between land, ocean, and atmospheres is one of the foundations that governs how Earth functions. 
                Carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) play a crucial role in governing global temperatures through absorption of infrared radiation. 
                On land, carbon is the currency shared between plants, microbes, and the atmosphere. 
                Through photosynthesis, plants remove CO₂ from the air to support their growth. 
                When plants die or leaves fall to the ground, soil microbes return much of this CO₂ back to the atmosphere through respiration. 
                In flooded wetland soils, where no oxygen is available, microbes known as methanogens produce and release methane gas (CH₄) rather than CO₂. 
                These processes are similar in the ocean, except that atmospheric CO₂ first dissolves into the ocean surface before it is used in photosynthesis by tiny plants called phytoplankton. 
                The rate and balance of carbon cycling between land, ocean, and atmosphere is modulated by the Earth’s climate, which includes environmental variability and changes driven by global warming.

        <section id="carbon-sources-sinks">
            <h2>Natural Sources and Sinks of Carbon Dioxide</h2>
            <p>
                The land and ocean currently absorb around 5 billion metric tons of carbon each year from the atmosphere. 
                This amount of carbon is equal to around half a year’s worth of CO₂ emitted from burning coal, oil, gas, and cement production. 
                These numbers show the importance of these natural carbon sinks, since without them CO₂ concentrations could rise twice as fast, speeding up global warming.
            </p>
            <p>
                On land, several factors combine to allow plants to absorb more carbon than they release. 
                When forests regrow, as they are across much of the northern hemisphere, younger trees absorb more carbon during photosynthesis. 
                Forests are currently regrowing across the northern hemisphere because most of the deforestation and CO₂ emissions occurred about 100-150 years ago, so regrowth in this area is in some aspects a recovery. 
                In some of these areas, more rapid warming in high latitude regions is also increasing the growing season length. 
                Higher concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere can also stimulate even more photosynthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the ocean, carbon uptake is controlled by a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes. 
                Absorption in surface waters tends to increase with rising atmospheric concentrations, but this can be influenced by changes in ocean temperature and circulation.

        <!-- New Section: A More Complete Picture of Atmospheric Conditions -->
        <section id="atmospheric-conditions">
            <h2>A More Complete Picture of Atmospheric Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                Since the establishment of the U.S. Clean Air Act in 1970, environmental managers have made great strides in addressing primary causes of air pollution by focusing on single point sources like smokestacks, and wider diffused sources, known as non-point sources, like transportation sector emissions. Since the early 1990s, the U.S. has also set national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to address the root cause of climate change, along with various federal, state, and local policies targeting smokestack and tailpipe pollution, in addition to other sources and sinks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earth’s atmosphere, however, doesn’t distinguish between sources and sinks. Greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide and methane, and criteria air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, are often emitted by the same activity and mix freely in the atmosphere. Other less-appreciated sources, like volatile chemicals, fragrant consumer products, and even trees, can also contribute to poor air quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plans to limit climate change by reducing GHGs generally lead to better air quality, but scientists need a detailed understanding of the exact mixture of pollutants and where they come from to develop the most effective strategies for protecting clean air and, in turn, public health and wellbeing.
            </p>
            <p>
                GHG datasets are generally built by estimating the rate of emissions from a range of activities, like energy production, manufacturing, transportation, and agriculture and land use, among others, and then scaling up estimates of total activity levels for a given area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The U.S. government has a long history of tracking source-specific emissions and trends of GHGs and criteria air pollutants at the U.S. national, state, and county scales, such as through the U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks and EPA's National Emissions Inventory.
            </p>
            <p>
                To complement these “bottom-up” methods, new and expanded GHG monitoring programs are working to measure criteria air pollutants directly in the atmosphere using sensitive instruments across a network of stationary and/or mobile platforms by ground and by sky. Airborne programs include NOAA’s partnership with United Airlines to measure GHGs using instruments installed on a commercial airliner and campaigns flown by NASA and NOAA to measure air pollutants over several cities in North America. The data is then fed into models that allow researchers to infer the source of the pollutants, offering a broader picture of atmospheric conditions.
